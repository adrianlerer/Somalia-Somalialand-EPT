**Claim**: May 2, 2021  
**Finding**: May 1, 2021 (per Daily Sabah, Hiiraan "Saturday")  
**Resolution**: Use "early May 2021" or "May 1-2, 2021" in paper for accuracy

### Discrepancy 2: Somalilandia Parliamentary Election Baseline

**Claim**: Delayed from 2010 to 2021  
**Finding**: Last election was 2005, not 2010  
**Resolution**: Clarify "delayed 16 years (2005-2021)" OR "scheduled for 2010 but delayed 11 years to 2021"

### Discrepancy 3: Supreme Court Ruling (July 2023)

**Finding**: NEC announcement found, but court ruling not located  
**Resolution**: Flag as "NEC announced dates July 2023 (legal basis uncertain)" OR conduct additional search for court ruling

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PAPER

1. **Use "early May 2021"** instead of "May 2, 2021" for Farmajo revocation (Claim 4)
2. **Clarify parliamentary timeline**: "16 years since last election (2005-2021)" OR "11-year delay from scheduled 2010 date" (Claim 13)
3. **Soften Claim 14**: "In July 2023, the National Electoral Commission announced election dates" (avoid "Supreme Court" unless ruling found)
4. **All other claims (12/15)**: Use as stated with confidence (HIGH verification)
