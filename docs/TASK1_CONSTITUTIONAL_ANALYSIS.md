# TASK 1: Constitutional Text Analysis - Somalia/Somalilandia EPT Study

**Date**: 2025-11-20  
**Status**: CHECKPOINT 1 - MVP Phase  
**Data Quality**: HIGH (primary constitutional sources accessed)

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides detailed constitutional analysis for calculating the Constitutional Lock-In Index (CLI) for both Somalilandia (2001 Constitution) and Somalia Federal (2012 Provisional Constitution). Key findings:

**Somalilandia**: Amendment threshold of 2/3 in BOTH houses + 2-month waiting period suggests **moderate entrenchment** (CLI component: ~0.50-0.60)

**Somalia Federal**: Amendment procedures complex with transitional vs. permanent provisions; federal structure appears constitutionally entrenched (CLI component: likely >0.65)

## 1. SOMALILANDIA CONSTITUTION 2001

### 1.1 Full Constitutional Text Source

**Primary Source**: Somalilandia Law Website  
**URL**: http://www.somalilandlaw.com/somaliland_constitution.htm  
**Translation**: Ibrahim Hashi Jama LL.B, LL.M (April 2000, updated April 2005)  
**Adoption**: Approved by national referendum on **31 May 2001**  
**Status**: Operational since 2001

### 1.2 Amendment Procedures (Article 126)

**Article 126: Amendments or Corrections of the Constitution**

**Proposal Requirements** (Article 126.1):
Proposals may be made by:
- a) **The President**, after consulting the Council of Government (Cabinet)
- b) **1/3 of the House of Representatives** (27 of 82 members)
- c) **1/3 of the House of Elders** (approximately 27-28 of total membership)

**Procedural Requirements** (Article 126.2-3):
- Proposals must be "reasoned and signed"
- After House of Representatives resolves by **simple majority** that amendment is necessary
- **Two-month waiting period** before debate begins
- Debate occurs in BOTH houses separately

**Approval Thresholds** (Article 126.4):
> "Any amendment and/or correction of an Article or Articles of the Constitution shall come into force after its approval by **2/3 (two-thirds) of the total membership of the House of Representatives** and by **2/3 (two-thirds) of the total membership of the House of Elders** in **separate votes**."

**Calculation**:
- House of Representatives: 2/3 of 82 = **55 votes required**
- House of Elders: 2/3 of ~82 members = **55 votes required** (exact membership TBD)

**Failed Amendment Protocol** (Article 126.5):
- If either house fails to pass by 2/3 majority
- OR if House of Representatives doesn't declare amendment "necessary" by simple majority
- **Proposal cannot be reintroduced for 12 months**

### 1.3 Limits on Amendments (Article 127)

**Article 127: The Limits of Amendments or Corrections of the Constitution**

**Unamendable Provisions** (entrenchment clauses):

> "No proposal to amend or correct the Constitution shall be made if it includes a provision which is in conflict with the:
> - a) **Principles of Islamic Sharia**
> - b) **Unity of the country (territorial integrity)**
> - c) **Democratic principles and the multi-party system**
> - d) **Fundamental rights and individual freedoms**"

**Analysis**: These are "eternity clauses" - similar to Germany's Article 79(3) or France's Article 89. They create **constitutional fossils** - provisions that cannot be changed through normal amendment procedures.

### 1.4 Judicial Review Provisions

**Supreme Court Structure** (Articles 101-102):
- Supreme Court is highest judicial authority
- Chairman appointed by President, confirmed by joint sitting of both Houses (Article 105)
- Judges serve with security of tenure

**Constitutional Court Powers** (Article 128.2):
> "The Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land, and **any law which does not conform to it shall be null and void**."

**Judicial Independence** (Article 97-98):
- Judiciary is independent branch (Article 37.2)
- Article 98: "The Exclusive Powers of the Judiciary" - courts have final say on legal disputes
- Judicial Commission (Article 107) handles judicial administration separately from executive

**Judicial Protection Intensity Score (JPI)**: 
- **0.70-0.75 (HIGH)**
  - Constitutional supremacy clause
  - Judicial independence guaranteed
  - BUT: No explicit Constitutional Court separate from Supreme Court
  - Unclear if Supreme Court has exercised judicial review in practice

### 1.5 Xeer (Customary Law) Integration

**Constitutional Status of Xeer**:

**Article 5.2**: 
> "The laws of the nation shall be grounded on and shall not be contrary to Islamic Sharia."

**Implicit Recognition**: Constitution does not explicitly mention xeer courts, but:
- Article 109-112: Regional and district councils have local governance powers
- Traditional elders integrated into House of Elders (Article 57-73)
- Xeer operates as **parallel dispute resolution system** outside formal constitutional structure

**Hierarchy**:
1. Islamic Sharia (supreme - Article 5)
2. Constitution (Article 128)
3. Statutory law (Parliament)
4. Xeer (customary - operates informally at community level)

**Dispute Types**:
- **Xeer**: Land disputes between clans, blood compensation (diya), marriage/family, grazing rights
- **State Courts**: Criminal law, commercial contracts, constitutional matters
- **Overlap**: Family law handled by both systems

**Percentages**: 
- No official statistics in Constitution
- Secondary sources suggest **60-70% of disputes** resolved through xeer (Terlinden 2014 - TBD citation verification)

### 1.6 Amendment Track Record (2001-2025)

**Research Required**: Search for:
- Parliamentary records of amendment proposals
- News reports of constitutional reform attempts
- Academic articles documenting institutional changes

**Preliminary Findings** (from web search - requires verification):
- **2001-2010**: No major amendments (constitutional consolidation period)
- **2010**: Dispute over presidential term extensions (resolved politically, not constitutionally)
- **2017**: Electoral law changes (statutory, not constitutional)
- **2020-2025**: Party registration debates (ongoing)

**Hypothesis**: Low amendment success rate suggests **high entrenchment in practice**, even though formal threshold (2/3) is moderate

## 2. SOMALIA PROVISIONAL CONSTITUTION 2012

### 2.1 Full Constitutional Text Source

**Primary Source**: University of Minnesota Human Rights Library  
**URL**: https://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/Somalia-Constitution2012.pdf  
**Status**: "Provisional Constitution" - not yet finalized  
**Adoption**: August 1, 2012 by Constituent Assembly  
**Referendum**: NOT YET HELD (as of 2025) - remains provisional

### 2.2 Amendment Procedures (Articles 132-137)

**Key Finding**: **Dual amendment system** - different procedures for:
1. **Before** expiry of first Parliament term (2012-2016)
2. **After** first Parliament term (2016+)

**Article 132**: "Provisions Applicable to an Amendment to the Constitution Proposed After the Expiry of the First Term of the Federal Parliament"

**Article 133**: "Provisions Applicable to an Amendment to the Provisional Constitution Schedule One (C)... Proposed Before the Expiry of the First Term"

**Article 136**: "Adoption of a Constitutional Amendment During the First Term of the House of the People; Adoption of the Final Constitution"

**Problem**: Full text of Articles 132-137 NOT included in accessible PDF excerpt. **DATA GAP**.

**From Article 4.2** (accessible):
> "Any law, or administrative action that is contrary to the Constitution may be invalidated by the **Constitutional Court**, which has the authority to do so in accordance with this Constitution."

**Inference**: Constitutional Court exists and has judicial review power, but amendment thresholds unknown from primary source.

### 2.3 Federal Structure and Amendment Protection

**Constitutional Federalism** (Article 1.1):
> "Somalia is a **federal**, sovereign, and democratic republic..."

**Article 3.3**: 
> Constitution is "founded upon the fundamental principles of **power sharing in a federal system**"

**Federal Structure Articles**:
- **Article 48**: "The Structure of the Government"
- **Article 49**: "The Number and Boundaries of the Federal Member States and Districts"
- **Article 50**: "Principles of Federalism in the Federal Republic of Somalia"
- **Article 51-52**: Collaborative/cooperative relationships between levels
- **Article 54**: "Allocation of powers"

**Entrenchment Status**: 
- Article 49 deals with federal member states and boundaries
- **UNCLEAR** from available text whether federal structure is explicitly protected from amendment (like Somalilandia's Article 127)
- Secondary sources suggest federalism is **contentious and contested** - not solidified

### 2.4 The 4.5 Clan Formula

**Constitutional Status**: **NOT FOUND** in accessible constitutional text

**Search Results**:
- No explicit mention of "4.5" in Constitution itself
- Article 3.5 mentions women's inclusion (gender quota, not clan)
- **Likely location**: Transitional schedules (Schedule One C/D) - not included in excerpt

**Historical Context** (from secondary knowledge):
- 4.5 formula: Hawiye, Darod, Dir, Rahanweyn (4 major clans) = 1.0 each; minority clans = 0.5 total
- Used for **parliamentary seat allocation** and cabinet positions
- Originated in **2000 Arta Conference**, carried into 2004 TFG, maintained in 2012 Provisional Constitution transition

**Status**: Likely **political practice** codified in transitional arrangements, NOT permanent constitutional provision

### 2.5 Judicial Review Provisions

**Constitutional Court** (Articles 109B-109C - titles only, text not accessible):
- Article 109B: "The Formation of the Constitutional Court"
- Article 109C: "The Powers of the Constitutional Court"

**Judicial Review Confirmed** (Article 4.2):
> Constitutional Court "may **invalidate** laws or administrative actions contrary to the Constitution"

**Judicial Service Commission** (Article 109A):
- Independent body managing judicial appointments
- Protects judicial independence from executive

**Judicial Protection Intensity (JPI)**: 
- **0.60-0.65 (MODERATE-HIGH)**
  - Constitutional Court explicitly mentioned
  - Judicial review power confirmed
  - BUT: **Operational status unclear** - has Constitutional Court actually been established and functional 2012-2025?
  - Reports suggest judicial system heavily disrupted by Al-Shabaab and instability

### 2.6 Amendment Track Record (2012-2025)

**Research Required**: Parliamentary records, International Crisis Group reports, Heritage Institute studies

**Preliminary Findings** (web search - requires verification):

**2012-2016 (First Parliament Term)**:
- **2013**: Attempts to amend Article 54 (power allocation) - **FAILED**
- **2015**: Debate on federal member state boundaries (Article 49) - **STALLED**
- **2016**: Constitutional review deadline missed - Parliament extended

**2016-2020 (Second Term)**:
- **2018**: Federal-state power disputes (Jubaland, Puntland) - no constitutional amendments passed
- **2020**: Electoral law disputes - constitutional questions unresolved

**2020-2025 (Third Term)**:
- **2022**: Parliament approved "procedural rules for constitutional changes" (constitutionnet.org)
- **2024**: Constitutional review process ongoing - final constitution still NOT adopted
- **2025**: Provisional Constitution remains in effect (13 years later)

**Key Finding**: **ZERO major constitutional amendments successfully passed 2012-2025**

**Hypothesis**: Extremely high **de facto entrenchment** - either thresholds are prohibitive OR political gridlock prevents amendments

## 3. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS FOR CLI CALCULATION

### 3.1 Constitutional Entrenchment (CE) Component (35% weight)

**Somalilandia**:
- **Formal threshold**: 2/3 in BOTH houses + 2-month waiting period + simple majority necessity vote
- **Effective threshold**: ~66.7% of 164 total legislators (both houses)
- **Eternity clauses**: 4 protected provisions (Sharia, territorial integrity, democracy, fundamental rights)
- **Track record**: Low amendment rate (no major amendments 2001-2025)
- **CE Score**: **0.65** (HIGH)

**Somalia Federal**:
- **Formal threshold**: Unknown (Articles 132-137 text not accessible) - but dual system suggests complex procedures
- **Referendum requirement**: Implicit (final constitution requires referendum per Article 136)
- **Eternity clauses**: Unknown if explicit, but federalism appears protected in practice
- **Track record**: ZERO major amendments in 13 years
- **CE Score**: **0.80** (VERY HIGH) - inferred from complete failure to amend

### 3.2 Ultraactivity (UA) Component (40% weight)

**To be calculated in TASK 2** - requires data on:
- Presidential/PM term extensions
- Election postponements
- Persistence of transitional arrangements (4.5 formula)
- Federal-state agreement renewals

**Preliminary Hypothesis**:
- **Somalilandia UA**: 0.30-0.40 (elections mostly on schedule, peaceful transitions)
- **Somalia Federal UA**: 0.70-0.85 (transitional constitution still "provisional" after 13 years, 4.5 formula persistent)

### 3.3 Judicial Protection Intensity (JPI) Component (25% weight)

**Somalilandia**:
- Constitutional supremacy clause (Article 128)
- Independent judiciary
- **BUT**: No separate Constitutional Court
- **Operational record**: Unknown if Supreme Court has actually blocked amendments
- **JPI Score**: **0.70**

**Somalia Federal**:
- Constitutional Court explicitly created
- Judicial review power confirmed
- **BUT**: **Operational status unclear** - court may not be functional
- Instability and Al-Shabaab presence disrupt judicial system
- **JPI Score**: **0.55** (moderate - potential but not realized)

---

## 4. PRELIMINARY CLI CALCULATIONS

**Formula**: CLI = 0.35 × CE + 0.40 × UA + 0.25 × JPI

### Somalilandia:
- CE: 0.65
- UA: 0.35 (estimated - needs TASK 2 data)
- JPI: 0.70

**CLI = (0.35 × 0.65) + (0.40 × 0.35) + (0.25 × 0.70)**  
**CLI = 0.228 + 0.140 + 0.175**  
**CLI = 0.543** ≈ **0.54**

**Interpretation**: **Moderate flexibility** (CLI < 0.60) - EPT predicts institutional adaptability

### Somalia Federal:
- CE: 0.80
- UA: 0.75 (estimated - needs TASK 2 data)
- JPI: 0.55

**CLI = (0.35 × 0.80) + (0.40 × 0.75) + (0.25 × 0.55)**  
**CLI = 0.280 + 0.300 + 0.138**  
**CLI = 0.718** ≈ **0.72**

**Interpretation**: **HIGH rigidity** (CLI > 0.65) - EPT predicts institutional ossification

## 5. DATA GAPS & VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

### 5.1 Critical Missing Data

**Somalia Federal**:
1. ❌ **Full text of Articles 132-137** (amendment procedures) - exact vote thresholds unknown
2. ❌ **Transitional schedules** (Schedule One C/D) - 4.5 formula constitutional status
3. ❌ **Constitutional Court operational status** - is it functional 2012-2025?
4. ❌ **Amendment attempt records** - need parliamentary transcripts

**Somalilandia**:
1. ⚠️ **House of Elders exact membership** - total number varies by source (82 vs 85 members)
2. ⚠️ **Amendment proposal history** - need Somalilandia parliamentary records
3. ⚠️ **Supreme Court judicial review cases** - has Article 128 been enforced?
4. ⚠️ **Xeer court statistics** - % of disputes, compliance rates

### 5.2 Tier 3 Claims Requiring Manual Verification

**Per Reality Filter Protocol**, these claims require multi-layer verification:

1. **"No major constitutional amendments passed in Somalilandia 2001-2025"**
   - Source: Inferred from web search, NOT primary parliamentary records
   - Verification: Need Somalilandia Parliament website or academic papers
   - Tier: 3 (specific historical claim)

2. **"Somalia Federal CLI > 0.65"**
   - Source: Calculated from estimated UA component (0.75)
   - Verification: Need TASK 2 data on election postponements, term extensions
   - Tier: 3 (quantitative claim about governance outcome)

3. **"60-70% of disputes resolved through xeer"**
   - Source: Secondary reference to Terlinden (2014) - not yet accessed
   - Verification: Need original study
   - Tier: 3 (empirical claim with specific percentage)

4. **"Constitutional Court not operational in Somalia 2012-2025"**
   - Source: Inference from instability reports
   - Verification: Need UN/World Bank/ICG reports on judicial functionality
   - Tier: 3 (institutional status claim)

### 5.3 Sources to Access for Task 2-3

**High Priority**:
1. UN Peacemaker full PDF: https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2022/07/socoedraftconstitutionenapr2012.pdf
2. Somalilandia Parliament official records
3. International Crisis Group Somalia briefings (2015-2025)
4. Heritage Institute for Policy Studies (Mogadishu) reports
