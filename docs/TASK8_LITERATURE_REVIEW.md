## SYNTHESIS: KEY THEORETICAL FINDINGS

### 1. Institutional Rigidity Mechanisms

**Increasing Returns (Pierson 2000)**: Institutions create positive feedback loops (coordination effects, learning, power asymmetries) that make change costly. **Somalia Federal**: 4.5 formula creates patronage networks → vested interests → amendment impossible.

**Path Dependence (Mahoney 2000)**: Self-reinforcing sequences lock in initial choices. **Somalilandia**: Bottom-up conferences (1991-1997) → clan buy-in → legitimacy → adaptive capacity. **Somalia Federal**: Top-down pacts (2000 Arta) → elite capture → rigidity → instability.

**Critical Junctures (Collier & Collier 1991)**: 1991 regime collapse = critical juncture. **Treatment divergence**: Somalilandia (gradual, inclusive) vs. Somalia Federal (rapid, elite-driven).

### 2. Power-Sharing Design Trade-Offs

**Stability vs. Adaptability**: Hartzell & Hoddie (2003) show power-sharing reduces violence but Tull & Mehler (2005) show it entrenches divisions. **Somalia Federal**: 4.5 formula achieves minimal representation but blocks evolution.

**Consociational vs. Centripetal**: Horowitz (1985) and Reilly (2001) argue centripetal institutions (incentivizing cross-ethnic cooperation) preferable to consociational (entrenching divisions). **Somalilandia**: Hybrid system more centripetal (clan elders mediate, don't rule). **Somalia Federal**: Pure consociational (4.5 quotas rigid).

**Constitutional Rigidity Paradox**: Elkins et al. (2009) find rigid constitutions replaced more often than flexible ones. **Somalia Federal**: "Provisional" for 13 years BECAUSE rigid (CLI 0.76). **Somalilandia**: Amended multiple times, still standing (CLI 0.54).

### 3. Natural Experiment Validity

**Exogenous Shock**: 1991 Barre regime collapse affects both entities equally (Menkhaus 2007). **Common baseline**: 31 years unified (1960-1991), same constitutions, same dictator (Battera 2004).

**Treatment Assignment**: Somalilandia declaration (May 1991) driven by SNM military victory, NOT by pre-existing institutional quality (Bradbury 2008). **Quasi-random**: Clan geography determined which groups controlled territory post-collapse.

**Border Discontinuity**: Miguel (2004) and Posner (2004) validate cross-border natural experiments. **Somalia/Somalilandia**: Same ethnic group, language, religion, customary law (Lewis 2002) → isolates institutional variable.

### 4. Clan-Based Governance Dynamics

**Hybrid Institutional Orders**: Renders & Terlinden (2010) document Guurti (House of Elders) as formal-informal bridge. **Functional initially**: Clan legitimacy + modern rules. **Ossifying over time**: Hoehne (2013) shows lifetime tenure, no elections → legitimacy erosion.

**Xeer vs. State Law**: Terlinden (2010) and Richards & Smith (2015) show 80% of disputes resolved by customary law (Xeer). **Institutional dualism**: Allows flexibility (Somalilandia) vs. rigid formalism (Somalia Federal courts weak, 4.5 formula rigid).

**4.5 Formula Entrenchment**: ICG (2003), Hassan (2020) document 25-year persistence (2000-2025). **Constitutional lock-in**: Not in constitution text BUT political practice with constitutional force. **Zero amendments** despite violence, state failure.

### 5. Control Variables & Confounds

**International Aid**: Eubank (2012), Phillips (2020) show Somalilandia's LOW aid (< $100M/year) forced local taxation → accountability. Somalia Federal HIGH aid ($1.5B/year) → dependency, no fiscal contract. **Aid endogenous to CLI**: Weak institutions attract intervention.

**Al-Shabaab**: Menkhaus (2007), ICG (2006) show insurgency (2006-present) explains ~65% of Somalia Federal violence. **BUT endogenous to CLI**: Weak institutions enable insurgency. **Somalilandia**: No al-Shabaab presence due to stronger institutions.

**Recognition**: Walls (2009), Phillips (2016) document Somalilandia's "recognition penalty": no World Bank data, no UN seat. **DESPITE handicap**: Better governance outcomes. **Suggests CLI effect robust**.

## RESEARCH GAPS IDENTIFIED

1. **No direct CLI measurement in literature**: Constitutional rigidity rarely operationalized as composite index (CE + UA + JPI). This study's CLI formula is novel.

2. **Ultraactivity understudied**: Temporal persistence of political agreements beyond expiration rarely quantified. Somalia Federal 4.5 formula = extreme ultraactivity case.

3. **Natural experiments in institutional analysis rare**: Most comparative studies use cross-sectional regression (Acemoglu et al. 2001) or case studies. Somalia/Somalilandia offers clean quasi-experiment.

4. **Clan-based governance mechanisms unclear**: How exactly does Guurti provide flexibility? How does 4.5 formula create rigidity? Process tracing needed.

5. **Long-term institutional evolution**: Most studies snapshot (post-conflict = 5-10 years). Somalia/Somalilandia offers 34-year trajectory (1991-2025).

---

## METHODOLOGICAL POSITIONING

This study contributes to three literatures:

1. **Post-Conflict Constitutional Design** (Table 1A): Tests Elkins et al. (2009) rigidity paradox in extreme case; validates Hartzell & Hoddie (2003) power-sharing durability trade-off.

2. **Natural Experiment Methodology** (Table 1B): Applies Dunning (2008, 2012) design-based inference to institutional divergence; emulates Miguel (2004) / Posner (2004) border discontinuity logic.

3. **Clan-Based Governance** (Table 1C): Extends Hoehne (2013), Renders & Terlinden (2010) hybrid institutional order framework with quantitative CLI measurement; tests ICG (2003, 2015) descriptive claims about 4.5 formula and Guurti.
